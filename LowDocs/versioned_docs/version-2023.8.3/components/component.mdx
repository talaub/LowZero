# Components

[Entities](../entity) themselves are not tied to any logic on their own.
To assign behavior to an [entity](../entity) components can be used.
Each entity can have multiple components assigned to it but only one component instance of a given type.
The components hold all the data relevant to provide the behavior they stand for to the assigned entity.
