# DirectionalLight

The directionallight component is a component picked up by the renderer.
This component adds a directional light source using the transform information provided by the [transform](transform) component assigned to the same [entity](../entity).

A directional light is usually used to represent sunlight. It mimics constant light coming from a certain direction without a specific origin point.

For a directional light the position and scale of the [transform](transform) are irrelevant. Only the rotation is important for the visuals.
