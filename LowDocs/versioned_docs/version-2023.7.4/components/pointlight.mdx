# PointLight

The pointlight component is a component picked up by the renderer.
This component adds a pointlight source using the transform information provided by the [transform](transform) component assigned to the same [entity](../entity).

For a point light the rotation and scale of the [transform](transform) are ignored. Only the position has an impact on the visuals.
