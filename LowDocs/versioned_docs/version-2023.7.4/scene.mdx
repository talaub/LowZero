# Scene

Scenes are essentially the equivalent of a full level or a entire area of a game world.
There can ever only one scene be loaded at a single point in time.

One scene is usually made up of multiple [regions](region) wether streamed or not.
These [regions](region) will be loaded together with their assigned scene and unloaded when the scene is changed.

## Creating scenes

To create a new scene the _Scene_ entry in the top menu can be used.
The dropdown menu lists an option to create a new scene.

## Switching scenes

The dropdown menu _Scene_ which can be found at the top of the [UI](widgets/window_layout) lists all created scenes.
Users can click of any of the listed scenes to load them.
Doing this will unload the currently loaded scene.
