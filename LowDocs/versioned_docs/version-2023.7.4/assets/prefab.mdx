# Prefab

Prefabs are also listed as part of assets and will are also managed alongside [MeshAssets](meshasset) and [Materials](material) in the [asset widget](../widgets/assetwidget).
The idea of prefabs is to have a template to create entities from.
Prefabs can be created from [entities](../entity) and then spawned into the [scene](../scene).
They store all the data of the [entity](../entity) and the assigned [components](../components/component) and the decendant entities.

## Creating entities

To create a prefab just drag an [entity](../entity) from the [scene widget](../widgets/scenewidget) into the [asset widget](../widgets/assetwidget).
Just make sure to select the _Prefabs_ category before.
Doing this creates a new prefab and saves it to a file located in `/data/assets/prefabs`.
The file will use the unique id of the prefab as the filename.

## Spawning prefabs

To spawn an instance of a prefab into a scene just drag and drop the prefab from the [asset widget](../widgets/assetwidget) into the [scene widget](../widgets/scenewidget).
The [entity](../entity) will automatically be added to the global [region](../region) of the [scene](../scene).
The entity's [transform](../components/transform) will be zeroed out which means that the entity will spawn at the center of the [scene](../scene).
