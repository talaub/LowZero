# Overview

LowEngine is a 3D game engine built using C++.
The engine is a hobby project and therefore does not fit requirements for any serious game projects.
Currently the engine is only available for the windows operating system on PCs.

## Architecture

The engine utalizes an Entity-Component-System (ECS).
Therefore a data oriented approach is chosen in order to put performance first.
Extra measures were taken to provide an easy to use API for programmers that resembles an object oriented structure.
